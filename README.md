# World Styles

World Styles is a GUI editor for Leaflet maps using CSS filters. You can edit the sample maps or import your own Tile data through an URL. 
https://leafletjs.com/

Sample maps used are from OpenStreetMap (https://openstreetmap.fr/, https://www.openstreetmap.org/), OpenTopoMap (https://opentopomap.org/) and Stamen Design (https://stamen.com/). Always check and use appropriate attribution in your project. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


## Learn More

I made this webapp when I couldn't find an easy way to tweak and experiment with colors and styles of interactive maps without having to use proprietary software. 
Please let me know if you have concerns or questions. I'm new to React and would gladly like to know if anything could be improved.
