2 Tweak the styling of the map with CSS filters by using the sliders. 
3 Copy the CSS by clicking the "Copy CSS" button in the bottom of the "Filters" dropdown.

## Learn More

I made this webapp when I couldn't find an easy way to tweak and experiment with colors and styles of interactive maps without having to use proprietary software. 
Please let me know if you have concerns or questions. I'm new to React and would gladly like to know if anything could be improved.
